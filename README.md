# Automated-Imaging-Performance-Tests-for-X-ray-Systems
## In the field of Digital Radiography, duplex wire phantoms are used to evaluate the quality of images and detection systems, such as unsharpness, noise levels, defects. Tests to measure these errors are standardized in norm EN462-5. Digital Systems require a constant and careful performance evaluation. Duplex-wire type Image quality indicator (IQI)is used to measure Basic patial Resolution (iSRb), where the smallest possible detectable feature is estimated. So far, most tools to measure this parameter rely on human interaction, which makes it impractical and costly for production machines. This work will introduce a proposed workflow and offer an innovative automated tool to measure these parameter from real generated data.
